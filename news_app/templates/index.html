            <p>Over the past several years there was a visceral shift in news consumption for many people; from regular morning and evening news broadcasts to a 24-hour news cycle. Terms such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/19/892728595/your-doomscrolling-breeds-anxiety-here-s-how-to-stop-the-cycle" target="_blank">Doomscrolling</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2017/02/06/suffering-from-headline-stress-disorder-since-trumps-win-youre-definitely-not-alone/" target="_blank">Headline Stress Disorder</a> popped up as a way to explain how people continue to be affected by the constant bombardment of new information and breaking stories. People have feelings about the news but our questions is: does the news itself project a particular feeling? </p>
            <p>With data gathered from the New York Times Archives API we analyzed over 50k news articles, within a full 3 year span, from 2015 - 2017. Natural Language Processing was used to examine sentiment across time, categories of news, and geographic location. You can explore the data through visualizations, testing the sentiment of your own news headline, and searching through articles by keyword.</p>
