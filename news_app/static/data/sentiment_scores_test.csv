Each of the agency's divisions had handled lab safety separately. In the past year, different high-security C.D.C. labs shipped out samples of anthrax, H5N1 bird flu and Ebola that had not been properly killed.

Massachusetts: New Effort to Move Bombings Trial,"Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the defendant in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, made a last-ditch effort late Wednesday to move the trial out of Boston. In a 32-page filing, they asked a federal appeals court to grant a change of venue, or at a minimum to order the trial judge, George A. O'Toole Jr., to hold a hearing on moving the trial. They also asked Judge O'Toole to delay the start of jury selection, which is scheduled for Monday, while the appeals court considers its request. Judge O'Toole has twice denied the request, most recently earlier Wednesday, saying the jury selection process could find impartial jurors. But Mr. Tsarnaev's lawyers insisted that would be impossible, arguing that virtually everyone in the Boston region has a connection to the marathon and is, ""in effect, an actual victim.""
