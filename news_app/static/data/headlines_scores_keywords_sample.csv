4,New C.D.C. Job Overseeing Laboratory Safety ,"A new job title — chief of laboratory safety — will be created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency said Wednesday. The move follows a series of lab accidents, the most recent of which may have exposed a scientist to the Ebola virus. Applicants are being recruited, and a spokeswoman said that whoever filled the post would report directly to the C.D.C.'s director, currently Dr. Thomas R. Frieden. Each of the agency's divisions had handled lab safety separately. In the past year, different high-security C.D.C. labs shipped out samples of anthrax, H5N1 bird flu and Ebola that had not been properly killed. Thus far, there have been no injuries and no spread of the pathogens, but the agency's procedures have been heavily criticized as sloppy.",0.4215,0.04162,1/1/2015,Health,National,['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'],"['McNeil, Donald G Jr', 'Frieden, Thomas R']","['Ebola Virus', 'Laboratories and Scientific Equipment', 'Accidents and Safety']",[],[],0.4215,0.04162

He's made tentative steps toward reconciliation over the years, but maybe none as convincing as inviting the agit-noise post-backpack rap duo Run the Jewels to open for him Friday at Madison Square Garden. Granted, Run the Jewels — the partnership of Killer Mike and El-P — are a favorite of those who might malign hip-hop's center. But there will be no mistaking, once they're on stage, their bona fides. And like Mr. White, they're brash and not terribly concerned with who they step on with their words. (Friday at 8 p.m. at Madison Square Garden; thegarden.com.)

Judge Marc T. Treadwell also asked Georgia corrections officials to produce all communications — ""emails, correspondence, messages, etc."" — regarding Ms. Diamond's transfer several weeks ago to Georgia State Prison. Ms. Diamond alleges that the transfer, to a prison with a relatively high prevalence of sexual violence, was ""apparently retaliatory"" for her lawsuit against corrections officials. Ms. Diamond, 36, is a nonviolent offender and first-time inmate who has lived as a transgender woman since adolescence, but has been held in prisons for men, most of them high-security, for the last three years. She claims in her lawsuit to have suffered at least seven sexual assaults as well as routine sexual coercion and harassment. In addition to safer housing, her lawsuit, filed in February, seeks access to the hormone therapy that is essential medical care for her gender dysphoria. She had been taking hormones for 17 years, she says, until the prison system denied her access. A Georgia corrections spokeswoman said on Monday that Ms. Diamond ""has been receiving the appropriate treatment assessed by Georgia Correction Health medical staff"" since March. This is apparently a reference to a hormone patch given to her in response to her lawsuit.

Joyce, the circuit attorney for St. Louis, found that Mr. Myers ""produced a gun"" during the encounter with the officer, Jason Flanery, who was working an off-duty security detail for a private company. Police had said Mr. Myers, 18, who was black, shot a stolen handgun before Officer Flanery, who is white, returned fire. Prosecutors said in their report that witnesses had seen gunfire coming from both directions and from two guns and that a semiautomatic pistol had been recovered next to Mr. Myers's body. Mr. Myers's family disputed the police account and insisted that he had been unarmed. Protesters marched for several nights after the shooting, and some drew parallels between Mr. Myers's death and that of Mr. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old shot by a white Ferguson officer in August.

The man, Anthony Lord, 35, faces murder and kidnapping charges. Mr. Lord is also suspected of starting a barn fire, stealing weapons and two vehicles, assaulting one person and leading officers on a chase. The authorities did not have a motive. Mr. Lord is a registered sex offender in Maine. The Bangor Daily News reported that he had been convicted of theft and domestic violence assault, among other charges. Lt. Sean Hashey of the Maine State Police said the sequence began Thursday night with a fire at a barn in Benedicta. Early Friday, a man was beaten in nearby Silver Ridge Township, and his truck and weapons were stolen. Later, Kyle Hewitt, 22, was shot dead and Kim Irish, 55, was wounded at the residence where the barn burned. Mr. Lord, the police said, left the scene with Ms. Irish's daughter, Brittany Irish, 22. Another man, Carlton Eddy, who drove by the scene, was shot in the shoulder. Police later received a call about a shooting at a woodlot in Lee, about 40 miles south of Benedicta. Kevin Tozier, 58, was killed and Clayton McCarthy, 54, was injured there. A truck was stolen from that scene, and officers searching for it found Mr. Lord and Ms. Irish at his relative's home in Houlton.

The terms under consideration included a bond exchange, which would mean a permanent loss for participating bondholders, along with measures to increase the likelihood that the bondholders would be repaid on the new debt, those people said. By improving the utility's creditworthiness, Prepa's borrowing costs would also go down. The total face value of Prepa's outstanding debt is about $8.1 billion; of that, about $2.4 billion has been insured. The negotiations cover only the remaining $5.7 billion. Prepa and its bondholders have been in restructuring talks for more than a year, and during that time its creditors agreed not to take any legal action to enforce their claims. The agreement was scheduled to expire at midnight on Tuesday, but people with knowledge of the talks said they expected that a deal would be announced early Wednesday.

More than 10,000 of the kits have undergone testing for DNA and other evidence, an effort that has cost the state millions of dollars. So far, 21 convictions have resulted from the evidence. But officials warned that the work of investigating and prosecuting cases still had years to go and would cost millions more. At a news conference with Gov. Rick Snyder, state and local officials said the tests had produced 2,616 matches with DNA samples in the F.B.I.'s national database, with evidence of 477 serial rapists and links to crimes in 39 states and the District of Columbia. An investigation by Michigan State University researchers, funded by the Justice Department, pointed to a chronic lack of resources, rapid turnover in the department and a sense of triage in a high-crime city as contributing to sexual assault cases' not being treated seriously enough.

In exchange, the state of Maine agreed to drop charges that he was littering when he spilled celebratory Champagne on the mountaintop and that he was traveling with an oversize group. Baxter State Park, the location of Katahdin, has said that so many hikers were breaking the rules, it might move the Appalachian Trail out of the park. That matter, which was not part of the case against Mr. Jurek, remains a question. Walter McKee, Mr. Jurek's lawyer, said that while Baxter was hoping the charges might limit the number of hikers, ""as a result of the attention, there will probably be more people on the trail and in the park."" R. Christopher Almy, who prosecuted the case, said the $500 fine — up from the normal $200 — reflected the seriousness of the charge.

""I was relieved at the numbers,"" Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said of October's 22 percent figure.

21808,Massachusetts: Cosby's Wife Gives Deposition ,"Bill Cosby's wife of 52 years, Camille, gave deposition testimony Monday in a civil case filed against him by seven women who say he defamed them, despite last-minute efforts by her lawyers to halt the deposition. A lawyer for the women, Joseph Cammarata, said Mrs. Cosby had been questioned under oath for two and a half hours in a hotel in Springfield, Mass. Her deposition will continue March 14, Mr. Cammarata said. Mr. Cosby's lawyers had sought to prevent Mrs. Cosby, 71, who was the entertainer's business manager, from sitting for the deposition on a variety of grounds, and filed an emergency motion Saturday to delay it. But Judge Mark G. Mastroianni of United States District Court ruled Sunday that the deposition should go ahead, although Mrs. Cosby was not compelled to answer questions about her private conversations with her husband. Andrew Wyatt, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby, declined to comment. The civil case is separate from the criminal charges that Mr. Cosby, 78, faces in Pennsylvania, where a woman has accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2004.

In the new special, ""Daddy Issues,"" he serves up a rollicking story about running a race in the Special Olympics and chastises the men in the audience over which urinal not to use in a public bathroom. And he finishes the set with anecdotes about his father that are both funny and penetrating. ""I'm so thankful that he put a little adversity in my life,"" he says.

He has since worked in many mediums, including television and cabaret, but has written a new musical about every five years. His latest, which starts previews Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Friday, Nov. 11, is another adaptation, this time of the movie ""The Band's Visit,"" about an Egyptian group that arrives in Israel to play a show but ends up stranded in a remote village after a mix-up at the border.

The exhibition revisits the human ordeal of World War II through previously unknown images of life in one of the many ghettos the Nazis built to isolate Jews and streamline deportation to concentration camps. These images reflect the determination of Henryk Ross, a talented Polish Jewish photojournalist and a rare Lodz Ghetto survivor, to document what he called ""our martyrdom."" Between 1940 and 1944, Ross took carefully staged fictions of ghetto life that served as Nazi propaganda, but he also secretly recorded the grim realities of what truly happened. As the war wound down, he buried 6,000 negatives in the ghetto, returning after Germany's surrender to find half intact. Ross eventually moved to Canada, where he died at 81 in 1991. In 2007, the Archive of Modern Conflict donated all of his negatives and contact prints to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which organized this exhibition.
